👋 Hi, I’m Jessica - aka @piegez <br><br> 
I'm currently deep-diving into Developer Full-Stack Python at EBAC. I'm working hard to finish this course in September and be ready to continue learning about coding and dev tools.<br><br>

Even though I'm going to finish the course in September, I'm already looking for opportunities to work in this field and enhance my knowledge each and every day. 📖💻<br> <br>
