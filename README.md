ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @piegez - aka Jessica <br> 
I'm currently deep-diving into Developer Full-Stack Python at EBAC. <br><br>
I'm also in the process of switching careers from English teacher to the one mentioned above. <br><br>
What I have learned so far: HTML, CSS, Java, Bootstrap, jQuery, and SASS. <br><br>
