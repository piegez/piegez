👋 Hi, I’m Jessica - aka @piegez <br><br> 
I'm currently deep-diving into Developer Full-Stack Python at EBAC, which has the following <a href="https://ebaconline.com.br/full-stack-python?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=course_41_backend-python_google_search_all_conversions_all&utm_content=c_12698714855|adg_117867437502|ad_512946427135|ph_aud-2172774920523:kwd-332100589876|key_back%20end%20python|dev_c|pst_|rgnid_1032123|placement_&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA8NKtBhBtEiwAq5aX2OTYfjsizyJslnDTT4L0Mu8xQqoPWR5zF48Qphy_VYz7Ubx8-cZRXxoCdgUQAvD_BwE">  syllabus</a>. I'm working hard to finish this course in September and be ready to continue learning about coding and dev tools.<br><br>
I'm also in the process of switching careers from English teacher to the one mentioned above. <br><br>
What I have learned so far: HTML, CSS, Java, Bootstrap, jQuery, and SASS. <br><br>

Even though I'm going to finish the course in September, I'm already looking for opportunities to work in this field and enhance my knowledge each and every day. 📖💻<br> <br>
